'''Has all the global variables and imports for the project

This module contains all the global variables and imports that are used throughout the project. This includes the following:
- Imports: All the libraries that are used in the project
- Global Variables: All the global variables that are used in the project
- Constants: All the constants that are used in the project

Imports:
    -  dask: Used to parallelize the data processing in the project
    -  pandas: Used to read and process the data in the project
    -  numpy: Used for numerical computations in the project
    -  sklearn: Used for building the machine learning model in the project
    -  pickle: Used for saving and loading the data and model in the project
    -  matplotlib: Used for plotting the data in the project
    -  plotly: Used for interactive plotting in the project
    -  graphviz: Used for plotting the decision tree in the project

Global Variables:
    -  dataset_pickle: The path to the pickle file containing the dataset
    -  dataset_pop_pickle: The path to the pickle file containing the population data
    -  model_data_pickle: The path to the pickle file containing the model data
    -  model_pickle: The path to the pickle file containing the model

Constants:
    -  topics_to_use: The list of topics to use in the analysis
    -  regions_to_drop: The list of regions to drop from the analysis
    -  cols_to_drop: The list of columns to drop from the analysis
    -  population_years: The list of population years to use in the analysis
        - Used to weigh years of the population data
    -  pop_sex_to_stratified: The mapping of numerical sex to its textual representation
    -  pop_race_to_stratified: The mapping of numerical race to its textual representation
    -  pop_stratified_to_race: The mapping of textual representation of race to its numerical representation
    -  dementia_statistics: The statistics for dementia prevalence
        - Used in generating the synthetic data
    -  rng: The seeded random number generator
    -  choices: The choices for the random number generator (binary as of now, can be extended to multi-class)
